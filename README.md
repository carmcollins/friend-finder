# Friend Finder

### About This Project
This project uses Express to create a Friend Finder / compatibility match game. Users will fill out a survey with their name, a link to a photo of them, and their answers to ten personality questions.

The backend of the game will then take the user's answers and compare them with a list of hardcoded Grey's Anatomy characters. Whichever character has the closest answers to the user will be their match, and their name and photo will appear in a modal on the page.

After a user fills out the survey, their information will be added to the list of potential matches. Then a new user can enter their information, and the fun begins again!

### To Play The Game
